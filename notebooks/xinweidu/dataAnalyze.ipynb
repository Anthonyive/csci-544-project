       "\"anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .\""

       "\"the interest in anchoring phenomena and phenomena in confined nematic liquid crystals has largely been driven by their potential use in liquid crystal display devices . the twisted nematic liquid crystal cell serves as an example . it consists of a nematic liquid crystal confined between two parallel walls , both providing homogeneous planar anchoring but with mutually perpendicular easy directions . in this case the orientation of the nematic director is tuned by the application of an external electric or magnetic field . a precise control of the surface alignment extending over large areas is decisive for the functioning of such devices . most studies have focused on nematic liquid crystals in contact with laterally uniform substrates . on the other hand substrate inhomogeneities arise rather naturally as a result of surface treatments such as rubbing . thus the nematic texture near the surface is in fact non - uniform . this non - uniformity , however , is smeared out beyond a decay length proportional to the periodicity of the surface pattern . very often the thickness of the non - uniform surface layer is considerably smaller than both the wavelength of visible light and the thickness of the nematic cell , i.e. , the distance between the two confining parallel walls . hence optical properties of the nematic liquid crystal confined between such substrates correspond to those resulting from effective , uniform substrates . more recent developments have demonstrated that surfaces patterned with a large periodicity of some micrometers are of considerable interest from a technological point of view ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) . a new generation of electro - optical devices relies on nematic liquid crystals with patterned orientation of the nematic director over small areas which can be achieved by chemically patterning the confining surfaces . for example , to produce flat - panel displays with wide viewing angles one can use pixels that are divided into sub - pixels , where each sub - pixel is defined by a different orientation of the nematic director , which is induced by the surface structure and subsequently tuned by the electric field . in addition to the technological relevance , nematic liquid crystals in contact with non - uniform substrates provide the opportunity to study basic phenomena such as effective elastic forces between the substrates and phase transitions between various competing nematic textures ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    whereas the influence of homogeneous confining substrates on nematic liquid crystals is now well understood , the phase behavior of nematic liquid crystals in contact with chemically or geometrically patterned substrates is still debated . one might suppose that theoretical calculations based on continuum theories should resolve the properties of nematic liquid crystals in contact with patterned substrates @xcite . however , such calculations are numerically demanding because two- or three - dimensional grids have to be used because of the broken symmetry due to the surface pattern . moreover , it is very challenging to determine metastable states and energy barriers between them which are important for the understanding of bistable nematic devices @xcite . in the present paper we adopt a different strategy which takes the advantage of the finite decay length characterizing the influence of the surface pattern on the nematic liquid crystal in the direction perpendicular to the substrate . we determine first an anchoring energy function and an average surface director orientation of the patterned substrate and obtain an effective free energy for the nematic liquid crystal cell under consideration . we find remarkably good agreement between the phase diagrams of various systems calculated using this effective free energy function on the one hand and the original free energy functional on the other hand . the continuum theory for liquid crystals has its origin dating back to at least the work of oseen @xcite and zocher @xcite . this early version of the continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals played an important role for the further development of the static theory and its more direct formulation by frank @xcite . the frank theory is formulated in terms of the so - called nematic director @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and its possible spatial distortions . the nematic director describes the direction of the locally averaged molecular alignment in liquid crystals . in a nematic liquid crystal the centers of mass of the liquid crystal molecules do not exhibit long - ranged order . the molecules can translate freely while being aligned , on average , parallel to one another and to the nematic director . it is known that if an initially uniform nematic liquid crystal is distorted by external forces , it relaxes back to the uniform state after the disturbing influence is switched off , signaling that the uniform configuration represents a thermodynamically stable state . therefore it is assumed that there is a cost in free energy associated with elastic distortions of the nematic director of the form @xmath2&=&\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_v d^3 r\\\\,\\\\left[k_{11}\\\\left(\\\\nabla\\\\cdot\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\right)^2\\\\right.\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\&+&\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\left.k_{22}(\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\cdot(\\\\nabla \\\\times\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}))^2 + k_{33}(\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\times(\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}))^2\\\\right],\\\\nonumber \\\\\\\\ & & \\\\label{eq1}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the volume accessible to the nematic liquid crystal and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are elastic constants associated with splay , twist , and bend distortions , respectively . the elastic constants depend on temperature and are commonly of the order @xmath7 to . sometimes , for example , when the relative values of the elastic constants are unknown or when the resulting euler - lagrange equations are complicated , the one - constant approximation @xmath8 is made . in this case the elastic free energy functional reduces to @xmath9&=&\\\\frac{k}{2}\\\\int_v d^3 r\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\nabla\\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\right)^2\\\\,.\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] in the presence of surfaces the bulk free energy @xmath10 must be supplemented by the surface free energy @xmath11 such that the total free energy is given by @xmath12 . in the corresponding equilibrium euler - lagrange equations @xmath13 , @xmath11 leads to appropriate boundary conditions . the description of the nematic director alignment at the surfaces forming the boundaries is called anchoring . in addition to the so - called free boundary condition where there is no anchoring , one considers weak and strong anchoring . if there are no anchoring conditions imposed on @xmath14 at the boundary , the bulk free energy @xmath15 is minimized using standard techniques of the calculus of variations . in the case of strong anchoring it is also sufficient to minimize the bulk free energy but subject to @xmath14 taking prescribed fixed values at the boundary . in the case of weak anchoring the total free energy @xmath16 , which includes the surface free energy @xmath11 , has to be minimized . the most commonly used expression for the surface free energy is of the form proposed by rapini and papoular by @xcite : @xmath17=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_{s } d^2 r\\\\,w({\\\\bf r } ) ( \\\\hat{{\\\\bf n}}\\\\cdot{\\\\nu})^2.\\\\ ] ] the integral runs over the boundary and @xmath18 is the corresponding anchoring strength that characterizes the surface . the local unit vector perpendicular to the surface is denoted as @xmath14 . for negative @xmath19 , this contribution favors an orientation of the molecules perpendicular to the surface , while positive @xmath19 favor degenerate planar orientations at the surface . the absolute value of the anchoring strength is commonly of the order @xmath20 to . here we consider a nematic liquid crystal confined between a patterned substrate at @xmath21 and a flat substrate at @xmath22 where the @xmath23 axis is normal to the flat substrate . as figs . [ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) illustrate , the lower substrate is characterized by geometrical and/or chemical patterns of periodicity @xmath24 along the @xmath25 axis . moreover , the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath26 direction . within the one - constant approximation [ eq .

( [ eq3 ] ) ] is adopted :    . the upper flat substrate induces strong anchoring , i.e. , @xmath31 , while the lower substrate is characterized by a surface pattern of period @xmath24 in @xmath25 direction . the system is translational invariant in @xmath26 direction perpendicular to the plane of the figure . in ( a ) the lower sinusoidally grating surface ( groove depth @xmath34 ) is endowed with an alternating stripe pattern of locally homeotropic anchoring ( white bars ) and homogeneous planar anchoring ( black bars ) . the period of the chemical pattern is half the period of the surface grating @xmath24 . in ( c ) and ( d ) a pure geometrically structured lower substrate and pure chemically patterned lower substrate , respectively , are shown . the anchoring direction at the substrates is schematically represented by black rods . quantitatively reliable predictions of the phase behavior of a nematic liquid crystal confined between two substrates at an _ arbitrary _ mean distance @xmath35 in ( a ) can be achieved if the effective free energy function [ eqs .

[ fig1 ]  ( b ) ) . thereafter the phase behavior , energy barriers between metastable states , and effective anchoring angles for the system of interest ( fig . [ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) can be obtained for _ arbitrary _ values of @xmath35 and @xmath40 from @xmath49 as a function of the single variable @xmath42 . such a calculation is considerably less challenging than minimizing the original free energy functional @xmath39 $ ] with respect to @xmath50 on a two - dimensional @xmath51 grid . however , the effective free energy method is applicable only if eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) can be inverted in order to obtain @xmath52 which is needed as input into eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) . the condition for this inversion follows from eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) : @xmath53 moreover , @xmath54 is practically independent of the cell width @xmath36 provided @xmath55 implying that the interfacial region above the lower substrate does not extend to the upper substrate .    before studying the nematic liquid crystal in contact with the patterned substrates shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] it is instructive to analyze first the nematic liquid crystal confined between two homogeneous flat substrates at a distance @xmath35 . the upper surface induces strong anchoring , i.e. , . the free energy functional defined in eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) follows as @xmath56&\\\\!\\\\!=\\\\!\\\\!&\\\\frac{klp}{2}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^d dz\\\\ , \\\\left(\\\\frac{d \\\\theta(z)}{d z}\\\\right)^2+f_s(\\\\theta_0).\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] the solution of the euler - langrange equation @xmath57 subject to the boundary condition at the upper surface @xmath58 interpolates linearly between the top and bottom surfaces :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 follows from the boundary condition at the lower surface . with this solution of the euler - lagrange equation the minimized free energy function reads @xmath61 it follows directly from eqs . ( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 hence in the case of homogeneous confining substrates the effective free energy function [ eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) ] agrees exactly with the minimized free energy function of the original system [ eq . ( [ eq12 ] ) ] . in the previous section we have shown that we can describe a nematic liquid crystal confined between two homogeneous substrates by the effective free energy function [ eq .  ( [ eq6 ] ) ] . in this subsection we apply this approach to the particular case of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a chemically patterned sinusoidal surface and a flat substrate with strong homeotropic anchoring ( see fig . [ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) . the surface profile of the grating surface is given by @xmath65 , where @xmath34 is the groove depth and @xmath66 is the period . as figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) illustrates , the surface exhibits a pattern consisting of alternating stripes with locally homeotropic and homogeneous planar anchoring . the projection of the widths of the stripes onto the @xmath25 axis is @xmath67 and the anchoring strength is specified by a periodic step function : @xmath68 and @xmath69 for values of @xmath25 on the homeotropic and planar stripes , respectively . figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) displays @xmath70 ( dashed line ) and @xmath71 ( solid line ) for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . the shapes of @xmath70 as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath71 as a function of @xmath42 are rather similar because @xmath75 ( see eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) ) for this set of model parameters . figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) displays the phase diagram plotted as a function of the anchoring angle @xmath40 at the upper substrate and the mean separation of the substrates @xmath35 . the calculations demonstrate the existence of two ( stable or metastable ) nematic director configurations : the homeotropic ( h ) phase , in which the director field is almost uniform and parallel to the anchoring direction imposed at the upper surface , i.e. , @xmath76 , and the hybrid aligned nematic ( han ) phase , in which the director field varies from @xmath77 at the upper surface to nearly planar orientation through the cell . note that there are two han textures : han@xmath78 and han@xmath79 corresponding to positive and negative average surface angles at the lower surface ( see also fig .  [ fig : diagram ] below ) . for small anchoring angles @xmath40 the han phases are stable provided the cell width is larger than @xmath80 ( more precisely , the han@xmath78 texture is stable for @xmath81 while the han@xmath79 texture is stable for @xmath82 and they coexist at @xmath83 ) . for smaller distances between the substrates @xmath84 the han phases are no longer stable because distortions of the director field are too costly in the presence of the dominating strong anchoring at the upper surface . the comparison of the phase boundary of thermal equilibrium as obtained from the effective free energy method [ eqs . ( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) , and solid line in fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ] and the direct minimization of the underlying free energy functional [ eqs . ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , and diamonds in fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ] demonstrate the reliability of the effective free energy method . ( see fig .

[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) . the solid line denotes first order phase transitions between a homeotropic ( h ) and hybrid aligned nematic ( han@xmath78 and han@xmath79 ) phases . at @xmath86 and @xmath87 there is a triple point where the han@xmath78 , han@xmath79 , and h states coexist . the solid circle marks the critical point at @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the limits of metastability of the han@xmath78 ( 1 ) and the h ( 2 ) state are denoted by the dot - dashed lines . the limit of metastability of the h state for @xmath82 and the han@xmath79 state are not shown for clearness . the lines and the solid circle follow from analyzing the effective free energy function [ eqs . ( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) ] while the diamonds represent the phase boundary of thermal equilibrium as obtained from a direct minimization of the underlying free energy functional [ eqs . ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5])].,width=302 ]     ( see fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) ) . the anchoring strength on the homeotropic stripes and planar anchoring stripes are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively . ( b ) phase diagram of the same system as a function of the anchoring angle at the upper flat substrate @xmath40 and the cell width @xmath35 ( see fig . [ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) . the solid line denotes the first order phase transition between a homogeneous ( h ) and hybrid aligned nematic ( han@xmath78 ) phase . the solid circle marks the critical point at @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the limits of metastability of the han@xmath78 ( 1 ) and the h ( 2 ) state are denoted by the dot - dashed lines . the lines follow from analyzing the effective free energy function [ eqs . ( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) ] while the diamonds and the solid circle represent the phase boundary and a critical point as obtained from a direct minimization of the underlying free energy functional [ eqs . ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) ] . for @xmath94 the phase transition as well as the limits of metastability can not be determined using the effective free energy function because @xmath95 is not known in the region close to its maximum . for clearness , only the phase diagram for positive @xmath40 is shown ( c.f . [ fig2]).,width=302 ]    we note that the phase transition between the h and han textures is first order despite the fact that the effective surface free energy favors monostable planar anchoring , i.e. , @xmath44 exhibits only a minimum at @xmath96 in the interval @xmath97 $ ] . a first order phase transition in a nematic liquid crystal device with a monostable anchoring condition on a homogeneous lower substrate has been predicted for the special case @xmath98 in refs . @xcite using the empirical expression @xmath99 as input into eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) . for @xmath100 this surface free energy has two minima at @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the interval @xmath103 $ ] , and as such is bistable , while for @xmath104 , only the minimum @xmath101 exists , i.e. , the surface is monostable . to study the stability limit of the h phase we expand @xmath105 in eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) around @xmath101 up to sixth order : @xmath106 the h phase corresponds to a local minimum of @xmath105 in eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) if @xmath107 , where @xmath108 a standard bifurcation analysis reveals that the transition from the h phase to the han phase can be either first order or continuous . the transition is continuous if @xmath109 , first order if @xmath110 , and @xmath111 corresponds to a tricritical point . in the case of a first order phase transition the phase boundary of thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath112 we emphasize that the order of the phase transition depends only on the surface free energy @xmath113 close to @xmath101 for @xmath98 . therefore it is possible to have a first order phase transition even with a monostable surface characterized by a monotonic surface free energy such as the one shown in fig . [ fig2 ]  ( a ) for @xmath114 $ ] or the empirical equation ( [ eq14 ] ) with @xmath104 as well the more general expression @xcite @xmath115\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] with appropriate parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 . first order phase transitions between the h and han texture are of particular interest for bistable liquid crystal displays . in a bistable liquid crystal display the two molecular configurations corresponding to light and dark states are locally stable in the thermodynamic space when the applied voltage is removed @xcite . therefore , power is needed only to switch from one stable state to another , in contrast to monostable liquid crystal displays which require power to switch and to maintain the light and the dark states . we now turn our attention to the case that it is not possible to evaluate @xmath118 from @xmath119 [ eq .  ( [ eq7 ] ) ] because the condition for this inversion is not satisfied [ eq .  ( [ eq9 ] ) ] . to this end we have chosen the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath74 for the system shown in fig . [ fig1 ]  ( a ) . figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) display ( dashed line ) and ( solid line ) while the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig . [ fig3 ]  ( b ) . as is apparent from the solid line in fig . [ fig3 ]  ( a ) it is not possible to determine the effective surface free energy function for the all values of @xmath42 because the upper flat substrate at @xmath36 is too far away from the lower patterned substrate in order to induce all possible average anchoring orientations @xmath42 . in other words , the anchoring energy at the patterned substrate is too large to be balanced by the elastic energy for the chosen mean distance @xmath36 between the substrates ( see fig . [ fig1 ]  ( b ) ) . nevertheless fig . [ fig3 ]  ( b ) demonstrates that even this partial information about the effective surface free energy function can be used to calculate the phase diagram for cell widths sufficiently larger than the width at the critical point @xmath120 .      in the last subsection we have shown that with a suitable chemical and geometrical surface morphology on one of the interior surfaces of a liquid crystal cell , two stable nematic director configurations can be supported . the zenithally bistable nematic devices that have been studied recently @xcite consist of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a chemically homogeneous grating surface ( see fig . [ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) and a flat substrate with strong homeotropic anchoring . the profile of the asymmetric surface grating is given by @xmath121 where @xmath34 is the groove depth , @xmath66 the period , and @xmath122 is the `` blazing '' parameter describing the asymmetry of the surface profile . such a grating surface has been studied by brown _ @xcite who found a first order transition between the han state , characterized by a low pretilt angle ( @xmath123 ) , and the h state , characterized by a high pretilt angle ( @xmath124 ) . strictly speaking , the h state does not correspond to the homeotropic texture ( see fig . [ fig5 ]  ( b ) below ) , but we keep the same notation as in the previous section for consistency . here we study phase transitions of a nematic liquid crystal in contact with the blazed surface in a more detail using the effective free energy method discussed in sec . ii  c.    in fig . [ fig : blazed ]  ( a ) the minimized free energy @xmath70 ( dashed line ) and the calculated effective surface free energy @xmath71 ( solid line ) are shown for the anchoring strength @xmath125 on the grating surface , the groove depth @xmath126 , and the blazing parameter @xmath127 . the effective surface free energy is asymmetric with respect to @xmath128 because of the asymmetry of the grating surface . as a consequence also the phase diagram , plotted as a function of the anchoring angle on the upper surface @xmath40 and the distance @xmath129 is asymmetric ( fig .  [ fig : blazed ]  ( b ) ) . however , the topology of the phase diagram is the same as in the case of a symmetric substrate ( see figs . [ fig2 ] ( b ) , [ fig3 ] ( b ) , and for a more general discussion sec . iii  c below ) . ( c ) and eq . ( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) . the locally homeotropic anchoring strength on the blazed surface is @xmath130 , the groove depth is @xmath131 and the blazing parameter is @xmath127 . @xmath28 is the extension of the cell in the invariant @xmath26 direction and @xmath85 is the isotropic elastic constant . the effective surface free energy ( as well as ) is periodic with the period @xmath132 but it is asymmetric with respect to @xmath133 . ( b ) phase diagram of the same system as a function of the anchoring angle at the upper flat substrate @xmath40 and the cell width @xmath35 with the same line code as in figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . the triple point ( where the han@xmath78 , han@xmath79 and h phases coexist ) is at @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and the critical points ( solid circle ) are at @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 . for clearness , only the limits of metastability of the han@xmath79 ( 1 ) phase and the h ( 2 ) phase ( for negative @xmath40 ) are shown.,width=302 ]    ( c ) and eq . ( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with local homeotropic anchoring and a flat surface with strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath98 ) as a function of the groove depth @xmath140 and the cell width @xmath129 . the anchoring strength on the blazed surface is @xmath130 . the lines correspond to different values of @xmath122 and denote first order transitions between homeotropic ( h ) and hybrid aligned ( han@xmath79 ) phases . for small @xmath140 , the lines extend to @xmath141 corresponding to a first order _ anchoring _ transition between planar and homeotropic phases . upon increasing @xmath140 the first order transition lines end at critical points which are not shown in the figure . ( b ) the energy barrier at the first order transitions with the same line code as in ( a ) . the lines have been obtained from the total effective free energy ( see eq . ( [ eq6 ] ) ) , while the diamonds correspond to the energy barriers between the planar and homeotropic effective anchoring which follow from considering only the surface contribution @xmath44.,width=302 ]    ) ) for the hybrid aligned ( han@xmath79 ) phase in ( a ) and the homeotropic ( h ) phase in ( b ) on the lines of the first order transitions ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) for a nematic liquid crystal confined between the blazed surface ( see fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( c ) and eq . ( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with local homeotropic anchoring and a flat surface with strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath98 ) . the diamonds in ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the two minima of the effective surface energy function @xmath142 . the model parameters and the line code are the same as in fig . , width=302 ]    we now concentrate on the most interesting ( from a practical point of view ) case of strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath86 ) at the upper homogeneous surface . figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) displays the phase diagram for a few values of the blazing parameter @xmath122 and a fixed value of the local homeotropic anchoring strength on the grating surface @xmath130 . for a fixed cell width @xmath129 , asymmetry ( @xmath143 ) leads to a decrease of the groove depth @xmath140 at which there is a first order transition between the han and the h phases , as compared to the nematic liquid crystal cell with the symmetric surface grating ( @xmath144 ) . upon increasing the groove depth @xmath140 the transition line ends at a critical point ( not shown in the figure ) , while it diverges as @xmath145 . the groove depth @xmath146 corresponds to an _ anchoring _ ( or surface ) transition between low tilt and high tilt _ surface _ states which are the homeotropic and planar effective anchoring states , respectively , in the case @xmath144 . the effective free energy method allows one to calculate an energy barrier @xmath147 between the two bistable states , which is _ not _ feasible by the direct numerical minimization of the free energy functional . the results of our calculations are shown in fig . [ fig4 ]  ( b ) . the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the energy barrier . with increasing groove depth @xmath140 the energy barrier decreases and eventually vanishes upon approaching the critical point . the diamonds in fig . [ fig4 ]  ( b ) denote the energy barriers for the abovementioned anchoring transitions of a nematic liquid crystal in contact with a single grating surface . the energy barrier between two bistable states is an important quantity for the design of a zenithally bistable nematic device . too small energy barrier , as compared to @xmath148 , would cause spontaneous switching between the two states because of thermal fluctuations , while enlarging the energy barrier leads to an increase of the power consumption . using the calculated values of @xmath147 ( see fig . [ fig4 ]  ( b ) ) one can estimate the energy barrier in a real nematic liquid crystal cell . for instance , for a cell of area @xmath149 and of width @xmath150 , and taking the typical values @xmath151 and @xmath152 , one obtains @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which seems to be an acceptable value . another important quantity in zenithally bistable nematic devices is the average director orientation at the grating surface in the two degenerate states . the average surface director in the han ( @xmath156 ) and h ( @xmath157 ) states is shown in fig . [ fig5 ] for the same model parameters as in fig . [ fig4 ] and for the values of @xmath140 and @xmath129 corresponding to the coexistence line . the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of @xmath156 and an increase of @xmath158 . for a fixed value of @xmath122 , the difference between the two angles decreases with increasing the groove depth @xmath140 and finally vanishes upon approaching the critical point ( not shown in the figure ) . hence the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the groove depth at which the bistability is observed , which improves optical properties @xcite , and to a decrease of the energy barrier , which lowers the power consumption of a zenithally bistable nematic device . on the other hand , also the difference between the two bistable states decreases which impairs optical properties of such a device . in section [ iiia ] we have discussed phase diagrams in the @xmath159 plane which can be described in terms of the surface free energy given by eq .  . however , it is instructive to consider a more general situation that the surface free energy follows from a truncation of the fourier expansion given in eq .  . to be able to study both symmetric and asymmetric surfaces we assume a natural generalization of eq . , namely @xmath160\\\\,,\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] which reduces to eq .   in the case of a symmetric surface characterized by @xmath161 . the angle @xmath162 that minimizes @xmath163 ( see eq .  ) is a function of @xmath40 and @xmath35 . the derivative @xmath164 is the susceptibility of the system that diverges at the critical thickness @xmath165 and remains finite and positive for @xmath107 . from eq .   the conditions for the critical angle @xmath166 follow as @xmath167 implying that @xmath120 and @xmath166 depend only on the form of @xmath113 . plane for the surface free energy given by eq . . @xmath168 and @xmath169 denote different ( usually non - uniform ) textures , the thick lines correspond to first order transitions , and black circles mark critical points . when @xmath11 ( defined on the unit circle @xmath170 ) has one minimum and one maximum the phase diagram can be either of type ( a ) or ( b ) . when @xmath11 has two minima and two maxima the phase diagram is of type ( b ) unless the minima are of equal depth , in which case it is of type ( c ) . note that the lines @xmath171 are identified with each other and the phase diagram can be considered as being on a cylindrical surface.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the extremes of @xmath11 given by eq . can be found easily only in the case of symmetric or antisymmetric ( @xmath172 ) surface and the same concerns the position of critical point . in this work , however , we are interested rather in possible topologies of the phase diagram in the @xmath159 plane , which result from eqs . and , and not in the exact location of critical points or transition lines . to draw schematic phase diagrams we consider @xmath11 as a function defined on the unit circle @xmath170 depending on the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath113 has either one minimum and one maximum or two minima and two maxima . this conclusion applies also to the function @xmath173 , thus , there can be either one or two critical points in the phase diagram ( see eqs . and ) . in the limit of large @xmath35 , there is always a first order phase transition between two non - uniform textures corresponding to the opposite orientations of the director at @xmath21 . this is because @xmath174 is not a periodic function of @xmath175 at fixed @xmath40 . to find @xmath40 at the transition we expand @xmath11 around its deepest minimum ( denoted @xmath176 ) , which leads to the approximate free energy : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the extrapolation length . since @xmath176 and @xmath179 are equivalent minima of @xmath11 , and both @xmath176 and @xmath40 are allowed to vary in the interval @xmath180 $ ] , the transition occurs at @xmath181 if @xmath182 or at @xmath183 if @xmath184 . with the above information we can now draw schematically the phase diagram ( see fig .  [ fig : diagram ] ) . since the vertical lines at @xmath171 are to be identified with each other the phase diagram can be considered on a cylindrical surface . away from the transition lines there is a smooth evolution from one texture to another . this means that at fixed @xmath35 it is possible to transform smoothly the @xmath185 texture into the @xmath186 texture , i.e. , without crossing the transition line , even for @xmath187 . we note that in some range of parameters , the phase diagram for @xmath11 with one minimum is topologically indistinguishable from that for @xmath11 with two minima ( fig . [ fig : diagram ]  ( b ) ) ; in both cases there are two critical points and a triple point . if @xmath11 has two equal minima ( e.g. , at @xmath101 and @xmath188 in the case of symmetric surface ) the triple point disappears and the first order transition lines extend to @xmath189 , as shown in fig . [ fig : diagram ]  ( c ) . we have studied the phase behavior of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a flat and a patterned substrate ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) using the frank - oseen model [ eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) ] and the rapini - papoular surface free energy [ eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) ] . an expression for the effective free energy function of the system [ eq . ( [ eq6 ] ) ] was derived by determining an effective surface free energy characterizing the anchoring energy at the patterned surface [ eq .  ( [ eq8 ] ) ] . using the effective free energy function , we have determined the phase behavior of the nematic liquid crystal confined between a flat surface with strong anchoring and a chemically patterned sinusoidal surface ( fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) , finding first order transitions between a homeotropic texture ( h ) and hybrid aligned nematic ( han ) textures ( figs . [ fig2 ] ( b ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) ) . it is possible to have a first order phase transition even with a monostable surface characterized by a monotonic surface free energy function ( fig . [ fig2 ]  ( a ) , @xmath114 $ ] ) . in addition we have performed direct minimizations of the original free energy functional [ eqs . ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) ] on a two - dimensional grid and found remarkably good agreement with the phase boundaries resulting from the effective energy function analysis ( figs .  [ fig2 ] ( b ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) ) . hence quantitatively reliable predictions of the phase behavior can be achieved using the effective free energy method .    using this method , we have also studied the phase behavior ( fig . [ fig : blazed ] ( b ) ) of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a chemically uniform , asymmetrically grooved substrate ( fig . [ fig1 ]  ( c ) and eq . ( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with locally homeotropic anchoring and a flat substrate with strong homeotropic anchoring , which is a typical setup for a zenithally bistable nematic device @xcite . the asymmetry of the grating substrate leads to a decrease of the groove depth at which a first order transition between the h and han phases occurs ( fig . [ fig4 ]  ( a ) ) . moreover , we have determined the energy barrier between the two coexisting states ( fig . [ fig4 ]  ( b ) ) . our calculations show that the energy barrier decreases with increasing the asymmetry of the grating surface but it is well above @xmath190 for a typical nematic liquid crystal cell . in addition , the average director orientation at the grating surface in two bistable states has been calculated ( fig . [ fig5 ] ) . the difference between the two bistable states vanishes with increasing substrate asymmetry , which has a negative effect on the optical properties of a zenithally bistable nematic device . we have also generalized the model of the effective surface free energy considered by parry - jones _ @xcite to the case of asymmetric structured substrates and obtained three possible types of the phase diagram in the plane spanned by the orientation of the director at the homogeneous surface and the thickness of the nematic cell . the asymmetry of the substrate causes only a shift of transition lines and critical points , compared to the symmetric case , but does not change the topology of the phase diagram . finally , we have verified that this model allows one to reproduce qualitatively the phase diagram of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a homogeneous planar substrate and an asymmetrically grooved surface ( fig . [ fig : blazed ]  ( b ) and fig . [ fig : diagram ]  ( b ) ) .\""
